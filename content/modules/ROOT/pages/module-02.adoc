Press the `+Create image+` button and you will be brought to the Create
image wizard. This wizard will ask you to define several aspects of your
new image. Image builder can define a custom filesystem layout, add
packages to your image, and even send it right to your cloud provier if
you’d like.

== ## Step 1: Specify image format

In Step 1. Image output, Let’s select only
`+Virtualization - Guest image (.qcow2)+`. But take note of the various
options Image Builder gives you for what format you’d like your image
built in.

We will also be setting the Release to
`+Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9+`, but notice that you can also
select several other releases for production and development use cases.

.Image Builder Step 1

With these options selected, Press `+Next+`.

== ## Step 2: Configure Insights registration

Step 2 is all about how you would like to register this system. Even in
the cloud, this type of image assumes you will be bringing your own
subscription. You can register automatically with an activation key, or
you can choose to register yourself later (either manually or using
automation).

To keep this lab simple, let’s choose to `+Register later+`

Now press the `+Next+` button.

== ## Step 3: Partitioning storage

In Step 3, we can manually configure the partitions of this system, or
we can choose to let Image Builder set things up for us automatically.
Let’s choose `+Manually configure partitions+`, this will open up a
table below where we can add new partitions.

Now, you can use the `+Add partition+` button to add more partitions.
You can also change the size or mount point of existing partitions in
the table. Even remove partitions that you may have added by mistake.

Let’s use the `+Add partition+` button to add a 5GiB /home and 2GiB /tmp
to our image. You should end up with the following layout.

____
_NOTE:_ This partition layout is for example purposes only, and not a
recommended production system layout. More information on manual
partitioning recommendations can be found in the
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/performing_a_standard_rhel_9_installation/assembly_customizing-your-installation_installing-rhel#manual-partitioning_graphical-installation[Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Installation guide].

Once your partition table looks like the one pictured above, press
`+Next+`.

== ## Step 4: Specify software

Step 4 lets us select packages that we would like installed on our
system. The base image produced by Image Builder is intended to be
small, and make very few assumptions about your desired package set. So
having the ability to add in packages here can save you time later. For
this lab, let’s add in a few packages. You do this by searching for the
package using the `+Search for a package+` text box. And then adding it
to the list of `+Chosen packages+` using the `+>+` button to add a
single selected package, or the `+>>+` button to add all listed
packages.

Try searching for `+vim+` you should see a list of packages that match
the word `+vim+`, select `+vim-enhanced+` from the list, and press the
`+>+` button indicating that we would like to add just the selected
package.

Then press the `+Next+` button.

== ## Step 5: Name your image

On Step 5 you’ll just need to give your image a name. This should be
unique, so try something like `+rhelworkshop-(your initials)+`

.Image Builder Step 5
image::ib-step5.png[Image Builder Step 5]

Press `+Next+`.

== ## Step 6: Review image configuration

Step 6 is just a review. You can review the choices you’ve made and go
back and make changes if you need to. If everything looks right, just
press the `+Create image+` button.

.Image Builder Review

This will submit your job to the Image Builder queue, and bring you back
to the list of images. Your image will be ready for download, or give
you the option to launch it on your cloud provider if you chose to push
it to the cloud, after the image is built.

.Image Submitted

In the next step of this lab we’ll have a look at an image that was
built with the same specifications to the one you defined here.
