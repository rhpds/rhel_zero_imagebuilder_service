Now that we think our changes in place, it’s a good idea to verify them.
We can go back to guestfish and look at the files in place on the
system.

____
_NOTE_: The -i option for guestfish tells the tool to inspect the disk,
and mount it for you. So we won’t have to go through the steps of
listing, and then mounting disk partitions.
____

[source,bash]
----
guestfish -a ./composer-api-ee3492f7-5d95-4c1b-a223-bbf04b9adef4-disk.qcow2 -i
----

$ guestfish -a
./composer-api-ee3492f7-5d95-4c1b-a223-bbf04b9adef4-disk.qcow2 -i

Welcome to guestfish, the guest filesystem shell for editing virtual
machine filesystems and disk images.

Type: '`help`' for help on commands '`man`' to read the manual '`quit`'
to quit the shell

Operating system: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.1 (Plow) /dev/rootvg/rootlv
mounted on / /dev/sda3 mounted on /boot /dev/sda2 mounted on /boot/efi
/dev/rootvg/homelv mounted on /home /dev/rootvg/tmplv mounted on /tmp

....

In the last step, we set the root password, and we added a sudoers drop-in.  Let's make sure both of the changes are in place.

```bash
grep root /etc/shadow
....

This should output root’s entry in /etc/shadow, we can see that a hash
is in place where it should be for the root users password.

____
grep root /etc/shadow
root:latexmath:[6]f.IB9InB1qla9fYT$OeOiVqhs5CMg/qx3xD7tvan0gIz.0mVJM.P3y0FEhRQqcTJhgiHPlDw6HYWDw1DIrGhuDl3dTzwhb7VWv0bAH/:19121:0:99999:7:::
____

....

>_NOTE_: Your hash will likely differ from the one listed above

Now, what about that sudoers drop in?

```bash
ll /etc/sudoers.d
....

____
_NOTE_: Guestfish feels like bash, but it is not. For instance, in order
to see the long listing in a directory, we might use `+ls -l+` in bash,
but in guestfish this will return an error. We must use `+ll+` instead.
____

____
ll /etc/sudoers.d total 16 drwxr-x—. 2 root root 24 Mar 27 18:45 .
drwxr-xr-x. 92 root root 8192 Mar 27 16:48 .. -rw-r—– 1 1000 1000 173
Mar 27 18:40 superusers
____

....

We can see that the file `superusers` is present, and the permissions are as we expect them.  Let's view the contents

```bash
cat /etc/sudoers.d/superusers
....

____
cat /etc/sudoers.d/superusers Cmnd_Alias SERVICES = /usr/bin/systemctl
start sshd, /usr/bin/systemctl stop sshd, /usr/bin/systemctl restart
sshd, /usr/bin/systemctl status sshd
____

%superusers ALL=SERVICES

....

You can now exit guestfish with `exit`

```bash
exit
....

At this point we can be reasonably sure that our image is ready to be
used as a base for new installs. You could however test further by
running a new local VM based on this image using libvirt, or by
uploading the image to your cloud provider to validate its
configuration.

Information on how you might upload a customized image builder image to
your cloud provider can be found in the documention:
